# Advent of Code : Elixir Flavor

I used elixir to solve some of the AoC challenges from 2020 and 2021.

I'm going to solve all of them but asynchronously with the advent period.

# Note

My intention is to learn by doing the challenges and I am not trying to say
my solutions are the best or the more idiomatic, even when I try to.
